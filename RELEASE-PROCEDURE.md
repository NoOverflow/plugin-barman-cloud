# Release Procedure

The Barman Cloud Plugin follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and
uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to structure
commit messages.
It leverages the [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
tool to automate the release process.

The only requirement is that each release must include versioned documentation.
For more details, please refer to [web/README.md](web/README.md).
